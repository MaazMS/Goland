## who invented golang?   
1. Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language
1. Go designed at Google  in 2007 and developed by `Robert Griesemer`, `Rob Pike`, and `Ken Thompson`   
and  a few other engineer But they launched it public in 2009 and an open-source programming language in 2012.   
   *  Ken Thompson (B, C, Unix, UTF-8)  
   *  Rob Pike (Unix, UTF-8) 
   *  Robert Griesemer (Hotspot, JVM)  
python: Easy to use, but slow  
java : complex type system   
c/c+ :  complex type system, slow compiler time    

####  [Why did you create a new language?](https://golang.org/doc/faq#creating_a_new_language)


## Documentation of glang
1. [The Go Programming Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec)
1. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)


## golang.org vs godoc.org

* golang.org
   1. standard library
   1. src

* godoc.org
   1.  standard library AND third-party packages

## go playground
1. formatting code
1. sharing code
1. run code
1. open go playground [here](https://play.golang.org/)


## Golang feature  
1. performant
1. multiple-cores (The first dual core chips for x86-based PCs and servers were introduced in 2005  )  
1. concurrency
1. compiled
1. network
1. clean syntax
1. powerful standard library
1. garbage collected  
1. portable (compiles on many OSâ€™s)   
1. open source

## Companies currently using Golang throughout the world
1. [GoUsers](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers)  


## What is package  
1. code that is already written which you can use in you project.  
1. It is import at the begging for source code.    


#### explain  
* package main   
1. Every go application structure as packages.  
2. main is special package.  
3. It is entry point of the application.    

* import   
1. It is used to add additional libraries   
2. fmt library is used to format string.    

* func main()   
1. It is entry point of the application.
