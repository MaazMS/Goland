## understanding control flow
1. Computers read programs in a certain way, just like we read books in a certain way.  
1. When we, as humans, read books, in Western culture, we read from front to back, left to right, top to bottom.     
1. When computers read code in a program, they read it from top to bottom.   

## SEQUENTIAL control flow  
1. computers read code in a program, they read it from top to bottom.   
1. This is known as reading it in SEQUENCE. This is also known as SEQUENTIAL control flow.  

## ITERATIVE control flow or Loop control flow 
1. A computer might hit a LOOP control flow. If it hits one of these, it will loop over the code in a specified manner.  
1.Loop control flow is also known as ITERATIVE control flow.    
   
## CONDITIONAL control flow   
1.  When the computer hits a CONDITION, like an “if statement”, or a “switch statement” ,  
1. It is called  CONDITIONAL control flow.  

* CONDITIONAL   
1. sequence  
1. loop / iterative  
      1. for loop  
        1. init, cond, post  
         
    1.  bool (while-ish)
        1. infinite
    1.  do-while-ish
        1. break
    1.  continue
    1. nested
1. conditionals
    1.  switch / case / default statements
    1. no default fall-through
    1. creating fall-through
    1. multiple cases
    1.  cases can be expressions
        1. evaluate to true, they run
    1.  type
1. if
    1.  the not operator
        1. !  
    1. initialization statement
    1. if / else
    1. if / else if / else
    1. if / else if / else if / … / else

**NOTE** In golang `while` loop is not used.
