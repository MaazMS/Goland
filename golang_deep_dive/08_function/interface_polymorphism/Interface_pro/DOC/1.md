### interface  
1. Go language interfaces are different from other languages.   
2. The interface is a custom type.  
3. It is use to specify a set of one or more method signatures.  
4. interface is abstract, so you are not allowed to create an instance of the interface.  
5. But you are allowed to create a variable of an interface type.  
6. interface variable can be assigned with a concrete type value that has the methods the   interface requires.  

* syntax  
```
type interfacename interface {

    // method signature 
    // method signature 

}  

```
