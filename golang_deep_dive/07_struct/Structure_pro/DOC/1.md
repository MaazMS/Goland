* synatx   
```  
type structname struct { 

    varname1 datatye
    varname2 datatye
    varname3 datatye
}
```

* Initialization of variable
``` 
user1 := userinfo{"value1", "value2", value3}
	fmt.Println(user1)

	user2 := userinfo{varname1: "value1", varname2: "value2", varname3: value3}
	fmt.Println(user2)
```
