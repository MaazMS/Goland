### Why is this useful ? 
1. We have some value these values have some meaning. example eggs price 70, Milk price 30, water 15.    
`menu := []float64{1.75, 3.22, 1.89}`
2. writing only value there is no meaning then map is use.  

### What is a Golang map?
1. The map data type is built in to Go. 
2. It stores kays and values.  
3. Read map keys are string and value are float64
```var menu map[string] float64 
menu = map[string]float64{
    "eggs" : 70.0,
    "Milk" : 30.0,
    "water" : 15.0,     
}
``` 
* Alternatively  
```  
	menu := map[string]float64{
		"eggs" : 70.0,
		"Milk" : 30.0,
		"water" : 15.0,
	}
```
### What map types exist in Go?   
1. There's no specific data type in Golang called map; instead, we use the map keyword to create a map with keys of a
   certain type, and values of another type (or the same type).
### Golang map key types   
1. What types of keys can a map have?
2. comparable means  == and != operators. 
map string, int, and so on are comparable.   
structs. Functions and slices are no map we can't have a map whose key is another map!.    

### Nil versus empty maps  
1. Declaring the map's type doesn't give us a value we can use: we can't read or write to a nil map.   
2. So if we don't have any values to put in the map yet, we can initialize it with an empty map literal:   
`menu := map[string]float64{}`
