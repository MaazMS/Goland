### Pointers  
1. It is used to store memory address of another variable.  
2. There are two operator use for pointer.   

` * operator`  
1. It is use to store memory address.  
2. It is also used to access the value of variable(variable has memory addesss).  
3. It is called as deferencing operator.   

` & operator`  
1. It return memeory address of variable.    
2. It is also access the address of variable to a pointer.   
3. It is also called address operator.   

* Example 
```
func main() {

	i := 10

	j := &i
	fmt.Println("retun memeory Address of i variable \t", j)
	fmt.Println("value of variable i", i)

	var k *int
	k = &i
	fmt.Println("store memory address of i variable \t", k)
	*k = 20
	fmt.Println("Access variable and change value\t", *k)

}
```
* output 
``` 
retun memeory Address of i variable 	 0xc0000140b8
value of variable i                 	 10
store memory address of i variable 	 0xc0000140b8
Access variable and change value	 20
```
