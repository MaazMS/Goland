## variables  
1. variable like a storage box for a value.    
1. The name of a variable allows you to access its  value.   
1. Go every variable has a type. it's called a static type, since you can't change the type of variable once you declare it.  
1. variable stores a value and that value also has a type. It's because Go is a strongly typed programming language.  
1. So a variable can only store a value that belongs to only one type.  
1. For example, you can't store an integer value inside a variable if the variable has a string type.   
1. Go is not like other dynamic programming languages such as Python or Javascript.  

## relationship between a variable and the computer memory.  
1. Go stores a variable inside the computer memory.
1. So a variable occupies some space on the memory depending on the variables type and its content.  
1. variables are only created after you run your program so they don't alive at the compile time.  
1. They only become alive in the runtime.
