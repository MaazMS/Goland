### Bitwise Operators  
1. There are 6 bitwise operators  in go.  
2. It work at bit level or used to perform bit by bit operations.   
3. `F T = T` and `T F = ` it XOR logic `^`.     
4. `>>` The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right  operand.    
5. `<<` The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.  
6. It return true and false. 
* Syantx  

* Example  

name of operator | sign of operator  
--- | --- 
 AND | `&` 
 OR | `|` 
XOR | `^`   
left shift | `<<` 
right shift | `>>`  
AND NOT | `&^`
