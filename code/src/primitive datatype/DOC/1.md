### Datatype   
1. Go language, the data type is divided into four categories.  
* Basic type   
* Aggregate type  
* Reference type  
* Interface type     

Data type name | Data types  
---|---|  
Basic type  |  Numbers, strings, and booleans         
Aggregate type   |  Array and structs 
Reference type |  Pointers, slices, maps, functions, and channels
Interface type  |

           
 **Numbers**  
numbers are divided into three sub-categories that are.  
1. Integers  
2. Floating-Point Numbers   
3. Complex Numbers  

**Integer**     

1. sign integer are positive and negative.  
2. unsign integer are all positive integer.   

Integer signed | range of Integer signed 
---|---|
int8  |8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16 |16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32 |32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64 |64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

Integer unsigned | range of Integer unsigned 
---|---|
uint8   | 8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16  | 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32  | 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64  | 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615) 

Init datatype | Description
---| --- | 
int  | signed, either 32 or 64 bits   
uint | unsigned, either 32 or 64 bits  
rune | alias for int32 
byte | alias for uint8.
uintptr | It is an unsigned integer type. Its width is not defined, but its can hold all the bits of a pointer value.

**Floats**
Floats | Description 
---|---|
float32  |   IEEE-754 32-bit 
float64  |   IEEE-754 64-bit 

**complex** 
complex | Description  
---|---|
complex64 |  Complex numbers which contain float32 as a real and imaginary component. 
complex128 | Complex numbers which contain float64 as a real and imaginary component.
