python: Easy to use, but slow  
java : complex type system   
c/c+ :  complex type system, slow compiler time   
###  go  
1. Strong and statically typed  
   Strong : The type of variable can not change over time.   
   Example: when declare variable as integer then we can not change the type of variable.    
   statically : variable are defined at compile time.   
2. Excellent  community   
* key feature:   
1. simplicity   
2. Fast compile fast   
3. Garbage collected  
4. Built-in concurrency  
5. compile to standalone binaries
