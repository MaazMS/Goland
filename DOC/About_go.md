1. Golang or Go Programming Language is a statically-typed and procedural programming language having syntax similar to C language.  
2.  It was developed in 2007 by `Robert Griesemer`, `Rob Pike`, and `Ken Thompson` at Google. But they launched it in 2009 as an open-source programming language.    
python: Easy to use, but slow  
java : complex type system   
c/c+ :  complex type system, slow compiler time   
###  go  
1. Strong and statically typed  
   Strong : The type of variable can not change over time.   
   Example: when declare variable as integer then we can not change the type of variable.    
   statically : variable are defined at compile time.   
2. Excellent  community   
* key feature:   
1. simplicity   
2. Fast compile fast   
3. Garbage collected  
4. Built-in concurrency  
5. compile to standalone binaries  (If go program binary run any os if go tool is available or not)    

#### explain  
* package main   
1. Every go application structure as packages.  
2. main is special package.  
3. It is entry point of the application.    

* import   
1. It is used to add additional libraries   
2. fmt library is used to format string.    

* func main()   
1. It is entry point of the application.
