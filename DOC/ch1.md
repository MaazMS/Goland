search engine 
Data = log in json form 
analysis log log time
issue help for GUI 
save all in elasticsearch 
push all lof form remote to elasticsearch use fluentd (eg. postman send log to elastic)
kibana is use to visualize data which is log 



Design Guidlines 
==============
1. Prepare Yor Mind

Design and archtiecture 
1. Harware is platform use by go
2. vm use java,python etc 

* god and bad wrong 

* cos and benifeit 

minimal team for larg program and application

self and reviw of code.  
 Thinkind about how it work.  

 ===============
 productivity vs performance 
 performance is matter ? 
 yes no
  performance number 1 priority
productivity is number 1 not performance 
then lose permformance

go provide productivity not loss performance 
replace go with c.  
language is tool we develop sound softare engineer practice we must design guideline p.
machnaic (how thing work)
semantic (how thing behave)

advantage 
software is relibale
software with integraty  
software is readable
software is  change issue 
====
correctness vs performance
optimize code for performance 
no it is not good desogn choose 
we optimize correctness
correctness : 
code review after 
simple code 
less problem 
''' 
simplesity
readablity 
minimizing
'''
performance 
''' 
latence(network, IO, Disk etc)
memory allocation
How you access data 
Algoritm step
'''
Read the code is more important first step. 

===========
code review
1. Integraity 
* code is relible 
example 
mobile is off how many person dia ? yes (entertainment ??)
a. micro level : every read and write , memory allocate  accurte and consistance other wise the issue is incrupt data 
b. macro leve : less code , error handling ,These paty of code 
2. Readability 
a. avg developer read code and undersand the code
b. code is not hide cost on machine and software
3. Simplicity 
a. Hide complixity (Garbage collector hide complixity )
4. Performance 
* cose and benifit 
10 thousand line of code not handle by avg developer.  

hide cost 
constructor and distructor
